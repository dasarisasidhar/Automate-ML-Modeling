# Automate-ML-Modeling
This repo is used to Automate Machine Modeling of Sklearn algo's:
    Give input of proprepossed data:
      it will train models and gives the model perameters how model is trained and how well it is performed on testing data.
      Using the Intrepreted ML gives the features which is imp and how closely it is tied up with the prediction of output from that             particular model
